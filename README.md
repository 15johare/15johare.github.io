             <li><strong>Birds</strong> come in all shapes and sizes,
             <li>my friend Kieran shot one of a roof and it played in a dogs mouth,
              <li>they are very stupid and fly into windows like James Kinsella,
              <li>their crow is annoyng, they can fly in the sky,
              <li>Feathers do many jobs for birds. Soft down keeps them warm,
              <li>wing feathers allow flight and tail feathers are used for steering.
              <li>The color of the feathers can be used to hide the bird or to help the bird find a boyfriend or a girlfriend! 
              </ul>
