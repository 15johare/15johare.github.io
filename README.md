             <strong>Birds</strong>come in all shapes and sizes, my friend Kieran shot one of a roof and it played in a dogs mouth,
              they are very stupid and fly into windows like James Kinsella, their crow is annoyng, they can fly in the sky,
              Feathers do many jobs for birds. Soft down keeps them warm, wing feathers allow flight and tail feathers are used for
              steering. The color of the feathers can be used to hide the bird or to help the bird find a boyfriend or a girlfriend!
